v1.0.0 freezes only irreducible semantic primitives.
Convenience algorithms, derived utilities, and composite abstractions
are explicitly excluded and may be introduced in v1.x.

A frozen module must be:

Semantically fundamental

Impossible to express more primitively without loss of clarity

Stable for long-term support
