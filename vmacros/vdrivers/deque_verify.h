/* vmacros/vdrivers/deque_verify.h                                [VERIFY-019]
 * ============================================================================
 * WP verification driver for the deque macro module.
 *
 * Shape: **B (provisional)** — the status table's classification, kept as-is.
 * Structurally the call is not in doubt: every deque function body exists
 * only inside an IMPL_DEQUE_* macro and comes into being at the
 * instantiation site, which is the Shape-B definition. But "confirmed" is a
 * term of art here — option, result and vec each earned it from the MC/DC
 * attribution check on their cover TU, and deque_cover.c is not started.
 * Do NOT upgrade this line on the strength of the WP run; the WP run does
 * not test attribution. The upgrade is deque_cover.c's to earn, together
 * with the Shape-A-drift tripwire vec established (deque_impl.h should show
 * functions-but-no-conditions).
 *
 * READ BY `frama-c -wp` ONLY. NEVER COMPILED OR LINKED.
 *   - Its `static inline` definitions would collide at link time with the
 *     same functions instantiated elsewhere. Keep it out of every build
 *     target and out of any globbed source root (see vmacros.md, build
 *     isolation).
 *
 * Integrity rule (vmacros.md): this driver instantiates the REAL shipped
 * macros. DEFINE_DEQUE_STRUCTS / DEFINE_DEQUE_FUNCTIONS are the two halves
 * of DEFINE_DEQUE, split upstream before this driver was written (the
 * split-patch-first checklist item, F3's deque analogue — the split landed
 * at CI #1225 and its expansion was verified byte-identical to the
 * pre-split monolithic macro across four linkage/type combinations). This
 * file is a second *caller* of the generated functions, never a
 * hand-written verified copy.
 *
 * Verified configuration: -DCANON_NO_REQUIRE -DNDEBUG, CANON_LIFETIME_DEBUG
 * undefined (per OWN-001 §7). Consequences, and they are sharper here than
 * for vec:
 *   - require_msg -> ((void)0). init's four guards, both
 *     push_*_unchecked triples, swap's pair, AND **peek_front / peek_back's
 *     d/out NULL guards** all VANISH. The `requires` clauses below carry
 *     those obligations.
 *   - deque has NO ensure_msg sites and NO direct CANON_INVOKE_HANDLER_
 *     calls (grep-confirmed: 0, same clean-audit shape as vec and result).
 *
 * Memory model: **Typed** (NOT vec's Typed+Cast). deque's own impl contains
 * zero casts, and its include closure is types/limits/contract/ownership +
 * error + option + result — no memory.h, ptr.h, slice.h, arena.h or
 * checked.h, i.e. none of the cast-originating headers. This is the first
 * data/-layer driver on plain Typed, and that fact is load-bearing for the
 * F4 experiment below — record the flag in the job banner.
 *
 * Linkage: contracted prototypes are `static inline` to MATCH
 * DEFINE_DEQUE_FUNCTIONS(static inline, int) below (C99 6.2.2p7).
 *
 * Representative instantiation: `int` (sizeof 4 — exercises the
 * capacity-bound division non-trivially, and matches vec's choice so the
 * two data/-layer runs are comparable).
 *
 * ── Module invariant (the load-bearing fact) ────────────────────────────────
 * deque is a RING, not a shifting buffer. Every index update is modular:
 * `(tail + 1) % capacity`, `(head + 1) % capacity`, and the two
 * `(x == 0) ? capacity - 1 : x - 1` decrements. Two obligations follow, and
 * both are discharged by `size <= capacity` rather than by any runtime
 * guard:
 *
 *   1. **Division by zero.** `% d->capacity` is UB at capacity == 0. No
 *      body tests capacity directly. push_*'s `size >= capacity` and pop_*'s
 *      `size == 0` early-returns make the modulus unreachable at
 *      capacity == 0 ONLY under `size <= capacity` — at capacity == 0 that
 *      forces size == 0, which trips both guards. If the invariant is
 *      mis-threaded, the division goals are what go orange.
 *   2. **Unsigned wrap.** `deque_int_remaining`'s `capacity - size` is
 *      computed unguarded on the non-NULL leg. It is deque's canary — the
 *      exact structural analogue of vec's fill(), and the first goal to
 *      inspect if the predicates are wrong.
 *
 * The ring also satisfies `tail == (head + size) % capacity`, preserved by
 * all six mutators and by clear(). It is NOT needed for safety; it is what
 * makes peek_back's `back_idx` and the pop_back postcondition provable.
 * Carried as a SEPARATE predicate (deque_int_ring) so that a failure to
 * prove functional correctness cannot be confused with a failure to prove
 * absence of RTE. Note the guard: at capacity == 0 the relation would
 * itself divide by zero, hence the `capacity > 0 ==>`.
 *
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * PRE-REGISTERED ARM CLASSIFICATION
 *   (required by the instantiation-identity rule, docs/vmacros.md §
 *   "Deque note" — written BEFORE the first report-only run, same
 *   write-down-before-the-run discipline the cover TUs use for predicted-
 *   uncoverable conditions. VERIFY-018's Correction note exists because vec
 *   did this reconciliation AFTER its run; deque does it before.)
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 *   ARM A — option_int: **INHERITANCE**.
 *     option_verify.h instantiates option at `int`, which is exactly the
 *     type parameter deque_int needs. Re-including it imports the verified
 *     instance. PREDICTION: **32 goals**, propagating byte-identically,
 *     `-wp-split` fragment indices included. Note 32, not 34: option's own
 *     job pins 34 = these 32 option_int_* goals PLUS the shared contract
 *     handler pair, and the pair is counted once here, under ARM C. vec's
 *     roll-call shows the same split (32 typed_cast_option_int_* entries
 *     alongside 2 handler entries).
 *     Sharper than vec's edge: vec ran Typed+Cast and so diffed its option
 *     arm only *modulo* the typed_ -> typed_cast_ prefix rename. deque runs
 *     Typed, the same model as option's home unit, so the names should
 *     match with NO prefix transform at all. A prefix difference here means
 *     the model flag is not what this banner claims.
 *
 *   ARM B — result__Bool_Error: **FRESH INSTANTIATION**.
 *     result_verify.h's home unit verifies the family at (int, VErr);
 *     (bool, Error) is a new verification subject, as it was for vec. Per
 *     the rule's explicit fork, this driver takes the FIRST option —
 *     attach the family's **full home contract set** — where vec took the
 *     second (reduced surface, recorded). All 17 home contracts are
 *     transcribed below, retyped int->bool / VErr->Error, shapes otherwise
 *     verbatim. Consequences, all falsifiable:
 *       B1. PREDICTION: **30 goals**, arithmetic rather than estimate.
 *           result's home unit residual is 30 = 2 handler + 28 own. vec's
 *           instance showed 22 = 20 profile-matching + 2 get_* MINUS the 8
 *           home `assigns` goals its lighter contracts never emitted. This
 *           driver attaches those clauses, so they should come back:
 *           20 + 8 + 2 = 30. Zero assigns goals would mean the
 *           int->bool / VErr->Error retyping dropped a clause.
 *       B2. The family profile should reproduce at clause-family
 *           granularity as it did for vec (20/20 there).
 *       B3. The 2 union get_* mem-access goals — the only two goals in the
 *           whole 30,127-goal dataset not pinned to a documented class
 *           (VERIFY-018 F4, attribution open) — should re-appear.
 *
 *   **F4 SEPARATING EXPERIMENT (free, no extra invocation).** vec ran this
 *   same fresh (bool, Error) instance under Typed+Cast; deque runs it under
 *   Typed, with the full contract set attached. Diff the get_ok/get_err
 *   rte_mem_access pair across the two runs:
 *       - pair PRESENT here  => not a Typed+Cast artefact; it is a
 *         type/contract-surface effect of the union extraction shape.
 *       - pair ABSENT here   => model-emission effect, attributable to
 *         Typed+Cast, and F4 closes as a memory-model note.
 *   Either outcome resolves F4. Record which, in the VERIFY-019 entry.
 *
 *   ARM C — contract.h handler: **INHERITED, predict exactly 2.**
 *     contract_default_handler's `ensures \false` / `exits \false` goals
 *     re-emit because the handler is DEFINED in the TU, not because deque
 *     reaches it (zero direct CANON_INVOKE_HANDLER_ calls). Same mechanism
 *     as vec's class (a), which confirmed at exactly 2.
 *
 *   ARM D — deque's own subject-side surface: **predict ZERO residuals.**
 *     This is the aggressive prediction and it is meant to be. deque lacks
 *     every structure that produced own residuals in vec:
 *       - no memory.h/arena.h in closure  => no allocation-model class (e)
 *       - no mem_copy/mem_move            => no element-transfer class (d);
 *                                            deque moves single elements by
 *                                            plain assignment, which WP
 *                                            relates exactly
 *       - **no loops of any kind**        => no macro-body-loop class (g).
 *                                            The roadmap pre-classified
 *                                            "deque's shift loops" into (g);
 *                                            that pre-classification is
 *                                            WRONG and is hereby withdrawn.
 *                                            A ring shifts nothing;
 *                                            deque_impl.h contains exactly
 *                                            one `while`, the do/while(0)
 *                                            of the contract idiom.
 *       - no fn-pointer parameters in the
 *         deque core                      => no class (f)/OWN-003, as vec
 *       - Typed, not Typed+Cast           => no bridging class (h)
 *     At-risk candidates, named in advance so a non-zero result is
 *     attributable rather than surprising: (i) the four *_option wrappers,
 *     which compose a result-returning or bool-returning callee with
 *     option_int_some/none across a driver boundary; (ii) the modular
 *     division goals, if the `size <= capacity` threading through the
 *     early-return guards proves harder for WP than the argument above
 *     suggests; (iii) swap's whole-struct copy, if field-wise ensures do
 *     not compose.
 *
 *   TOTAL PREDICTED UNPROVED: **64** = 2 (ARM C) + 32 (ARM A) + 30
 *     (ARM B) + 0 (ARM D) + 0 core substrate. The core-arm zero is its own
 *     claim: vec inherited 89 goals byte-identically from arena.h, and
 *     deque's closure contains none of the headers they come from. This is
 *     the first module whose inherited surface is SMALLER than its
 *     predecessor's — composability tested in the opposite direction from
 *     every prior confirmation, which have all been "propagates downward
 *     without amplification".
 *
 *   RUNTIME PREDICTION: well under vec's ~2h50m. vec's wall clock was
 *   timeout-dominated (193 x 120s) and the bulk of that was the 89-goal
 *   core arithmetic arm plus the 24 fill-loop goals, neither of which deque
 *   has. If deque's job approaches vec's, ARM D is wrong somewhere.
 *
 * ── Findings from the pre-run read (docs follow-ups, not blockers) ─────────
 *
 *   F1 (deque) — **NULL-guard asymmetry between peek_* and pop_*.**
 *     pop_front/pop_back test `!d || !out || !d->buffer` at RUNTIME and stay
 *     NULL-safe under any configuration. peek_front/peek_back instead use
 *     require_msg for d and out — so under -DCANON_NO_REQUIRE they become
 *     raw dereferences, while their same-named pop_ siblings do not. Both
 *     families are "safe" variants by name (the unchecked variants are
 *     separately spelled *_unchecked). The contracts below carry the
 *     obligation, so this is not a soundness problem for the proof, but the
 *     shipped doc comment does not flag the asymmetry. Recommend a doc
 *     patch on deque_decl.h/deque_impl.h; no code change proposed.
 *
 *   F2 (deque) — **a NULL deque is simultaneously empty and full.**
 *     `is_empty` returns `!d || size == 0` and `is_full` returns
 *     `!d || size >= capacity`; both answer true for NULL. Defensible as
 *     fail-closed on both sides (a NULL deque can neither be read nor
 *     written), and the contracts below state it explicitly rather than
 *     smoothing it over, but callers writing `if (!is_full(d)) push(...)`
 *     get the right behaviour while `if (!is_empty(d)) pop(...)` also gets
 *     the right behaviour only by accident of the pop_ NULL check. Worth an
 *     explicit sentence in the module doc.
 *
 *   F3 (deque) — **`int out = {0};` in the four *_option wrappers.**
 *     Brace-initialising a scalar is legal C99 (6.7.8p11 via p16) but is an
 *     unusual spelling and reads as a struct initialiser. Cosmetic;
 *     mentioned only so the pre-run read is complete.
 *
 * ── Run results ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   RUN 1 (report-only)  : pending
 *   RUN 2 (report-only)  : pending
 *   RUN 3 (baseline)     : pending
 *   ENFORCED             : pending
 *   Per the region.h -> enforced pattern and VERIFY-018's three-run pinning
 *   discipline, nothing is asserted here until report-only lands. Fill the
 *   scorecard against the ARM A-D predictions above, naming each as
 *   CONFIRMED / REFUTED / ADJUSTED.
