/* test/core/primitives/lifetime_test.c
 * ============================================================================
 * Sequential tests for the lifetime token generator (VERIFY-021).
 *
 * Division of labour with test/concurrency/lifetime_token_test.c: that file
 * tests the COUNTER under concurrency — whether two threads can draw the same
 * value. This file tests the SEQUENTIAL properties, which are the ones the
 * ACSL contract claims, and it is the runtime witness for them. Neither file
 * subsumes the other and neither reimplements the generator: both call the
 * shipped `canon_lifetime_next_id_` directly, per the one-source-of-truth
 * rule in docs/vmacros.md.
 *
 * ── What the contract claims, and what this file checks ───────────────────
 *
 *   ensures \result != REGION_ID_STATIC
 *       Checked here over every owner kind the library can be handed. This
 *       is the property with teeth: handing out 0 would mark the owner as
 *       static-lifetime, so borrows over it would stop expiring and the
 *       instrument would fail OPEN.
 *
 *   assigns counter_
 *       Not directly observable from outside the function — `counter_` has
 *       internal linkage inside the function body. Its EFFECT is observable
 *       and is checked: two calls with the same owner return different ids,
 *       which is only possible if the counter advanced.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately NOT tested, and why ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The REGION_ID_STATIC guard's TRUE leg is NOT driven, and cannot be driven
 * from a hosted test. It fires exactly when `c_ == (uintptr_t)owner_` — the
 * call counter equal to the owner's address. On this runner that requires the
 * counter to walk to a stack or heap address, order 1e14 calls. On a
 * low-address embedded target it is a few thousand calls and is ordinary,
 * which is why the guard is live code and not dead code.
 *
 * The correct disposition is therefore an MC/DC JUSTIFICATION ROW, not a
 * test — the bitset J1-J4 precedent (MCDC-012), where a branch dead by
 * invariant took a justification rather than a contrived driver. Forcing this
 * one would mean reimplementing the generator with an injectable counter,
 * i.e. verifying a copy, which the project does not do.
 *
 * ── A property the generator does NOT have ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Ids are not injective. The guard maps the xor-cancelling case onto 1, and 1
 * is also produced directly when `counter ^ address == 1`, so two distinct
 * owners can receive the same id. The rate is negligible and this is not a
 * defect. It is recorded because a reader may otherwise assume uniqueness.
 * test_distinct_live_owners below checks the property that actually holds in
 * practice — distinct simultaneously-live owners get distinct ids — and its
 * comment records that this is an observation, not a guarantee.
 * ============================================================================ */
