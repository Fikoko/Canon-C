# Release Clarification

Early CANON-C releases (v0.1.x – v0.2.x) document the evolution of the project
and may describe modules that were later reclassified or removed.

These releases should be read as:
- Historical snapshots
- Design exploration
- Progressive narrowing toward a canonical core

Only versions ≥ v1.0.0 are considered semantically frozen.

No released code has been retroactively changed.
Only documentation and classification have been clarified.
